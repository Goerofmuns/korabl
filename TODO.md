#Work todo
This file is where I put all of the stuff I think of, so I don't forget it.

##Game
* Implement a local coordinates system independent of window resolution
* Implement a modular system for panels
* remove the hardcoded aspects, make parts and ships more modular
* get texture manager to auto scan textures
* better movement system, maybe use mouse?
* game heirarchy:
```
    Space
      |
      |
    Vessel
      |
      | <- Docking
      |
    Module
      |
      | <- Contains
      |
    Objects
```

##Computer
* integrate the CPU from [Astro](https://github.com/Goerofmuns/Astro)
* make a functional panel for control
* make a TTY, teletype or screen
* give CPU control over flight
* give CPU a user interface

##Flight
* Create an open space area, where ships can fly freely
* objects like asteroids and derelicts
* docking system between ships
* (maybe) orbital mechanics system
* (maybe, long term) multiple ships to choose from

##Art
* draw a soyuz or apollo
