# Ideas for development

This file is where I put all of the stuff I think of, so I don't forget it.

## Misc
* create proper resolution scaling
* get texture manager to auto scan textures
* get gui into own files

## TKS
IMPORTANT: Model spacecraft, then on update change colliders, then on render change textures.

## Player

* Draw Better textures...
* better movement system, maybe use mouse?
* flight gui implementation
