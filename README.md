![My HD TKS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Goerofmuns/korabl/master/asset/tex/tks_shell.png)

Space game, featuring the infamous TKS spacecraft. Written in C++ and SFML. Should build on
Linux and OSX with Make and Windows with Visual Studio, all the build files are in the vsjunk folder.

TODO.md has all of my goals and ideas. Priority 1 is implementing the basic game skeleton, and making it top down. 
This requires redrawing the side view TKS as top down.
