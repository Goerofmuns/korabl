![My HD TKS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Goerofmuns/korabl/master/asset/tex/tks_shell.png)

Space game, featuring the infamous TKS spacecraft. Written in C++ and SFML. Should build on Linux with Make and Windows with Visual Studio, all the build files are in the vsjunk folder. Builds on OSX nicely.

I would like to add a flight computer to the TKS, implement better character controls and of course the all important flight mechanics. I also want to add a Salyut or even Mir to dock to.
